Daniel Chow received his Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, the Master degree from University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, and the Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan. He worked in the microwave and semiconductor industries for over 35 years in the development of microwave RF ICs and subsystems for 2 to 140 GHz applications using GaAs HBT, InGaAs and InP pHEMTs, CMOS, and Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) technologies.

Daniel served as the Vice President of RF Division, Microchip Technology, Los Angeles, CA from 2010 to 2015, where he directed the business planning and product development for WLAN front end products used in smartphones phones and WLAN routers. He was the co-founder and president of G-Plus, Inc., Santa Monica, CA, from July 2001 to Nov 2004 before it joined SST Corporation as one of its business units. He continued serving as the president of this BU until SST’s merger with Microchip in 2010. His team at G-Plus and SST developed the world’s first 5 GHz chipset for wireless speakers and highly efficient 2.4 and 5 GHz HBT power amplifiers for WLAN applications. From 1986 to 2001, he was with TRW Space & Electronics Group, Redondo Beach, CA, where he led teams to develop pioneering millimeter wave transceivers and solid state power amplifiers for satellite communications terminals and cellular phone base stations. Prior to TRW, he worked at Rockwell International and Xerox Corporation as CMOS device/process development engineer for 5 years. Daniel authored/co-authored 38 papers in reputable journals and technical conferences and is the Inventor/coinventor of 10 US patents.
